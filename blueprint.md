# Tetris Game Blueprint

## Overview

A simple, client-side Tetris game with a retro, early 2000s design. The game will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no server-side components.

## Current Implementation

### Features:
- **Basic HTML Structure:** A simple HTML file to host the game.
- **CSS Styling:** Basic CSS for the game's appearance.
- **JavaScript Logic:** The core game logic will be implemented in `main.js`.
- **Game Board:** A canvas element represents the game board, with a grid drawn on it.
- **Tetrominoes:** Definition of various Tetris pieces (tetrominoes) and their corresponding colors.
- **Piece Drawing:** Functions to create random tetrominoes and draw them on the game board.

### Design:
- **Color Palette:** The design will use a color palette reminiscent of early 2000s computer games (dark blue background, bright green text, red shadow for title, silver border for container).
- **Font:** A monospace font ('Courier New', Courier, monospace) is used for a retro feel.
- **Layout:** A simple layout with the game board, score, and next piece preview.

## Plan

5.  **Controls:** Add keyboard event listeners for player controls.
6.  **Styling:** Style the game with an early 2000s aesthetic.
